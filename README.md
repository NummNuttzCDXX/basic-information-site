# Node.js - "Informational Site"
This is an assignment in The Odin Project's curriculum demonstrating the basics of Node.js.

A dummy webpage to demonstrate the use of Node to serve up the correct files based on the requested URL.
I had some trouble, at first, understanding exactly how it all worked, but after asking chat-GPT a few clarifying questions
it was all clear to me.

I was curious how the server even gets ran when you open the index.html file without it being connected to the server file through a `<script>` tag. I realized that the html file doesnt get ran at all and you just run the server file through Node and the server brings the file to the webpage. That seems obvious now, but wasnt clear to me in the beginning when I started to write the code. I knew the server serves the files to the user but I guess it just didnt click all the way how it all works, until I started trying to write the code.
